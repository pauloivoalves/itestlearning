Built using technologies learned in the course, this project was first developed as a final course project necessary to achieve the
Bachelor degree of the Federal University of Cear√°. It was developed by the student Virginia Farias along with her counselor and them maintained by me and two other friends.

The project consists in a tool to help professors in the labor ot teaching software tests.
It uses concepts of gamification to explain the different types of tests that can be used/applied during the software development process.
